His creative approach has been inspiring for our child and she is thoroughly enjoying the lessons! He always takes the time to ask her how her week has been in general - and also asks her about some of the songs/music she might like to learn to play. Thanks to Theo, she is starting to feel confident and motivated on the guitar! Iâ€™d highly recommend him to others.",
